              <a href="article.html">"PEACHPIT Ad Fraud Botnet Exploits Hundreds of Thousands of Android and iOS Devices, Part of China-Based Operation BADBOX"</a>
            </h3>
            <p> <b>Over 15 Million Installations of Infected Apps Detected Across 227 Countries and Territories</b>

<b>The Scope of the Operation:</b>

<p>The PEACHPIT botnet has made headlines due to its vast reach, with associated apps detected in 227 countries and territories. At its peak, the botnet was estimated to have controlled 121,000 Android devices daily and 159,000 iOS devices daily. The operation was orchestrated through a collection of 39 apps that had been installed over 15 million times.</p>

<b>The Malicious Activities:</b>

<p>Devices infected with PEACHPIT were manipulated to steal sensitive data, create residential proxy exit peers, and commit ad fraud through counterfeit apps. Although it's still unclear how Android devices were compromised with a firmware backdoor, evidence suggests a hardware supply chain attack was involved. Additionally, threat actors used the backdoored devices to create WhatsApp and Gmail accounts, evading typical bot detection.</p>

<b>Previous Discoveries and Attribution:</b>

<p>Details about this criminal enterprise were first documented by cybersecurity firm Trend Micro in May 2023, with the operation attributed to an adversary known as Lemon Group. The investigation identified over 200 distinct Android device types, including mobile phones, tablets, and connected TV products, exhibiting signs of BADBOX infection, indicating the widespread nature of this operation.</p>

<b>Counterfeit Apps and Ad Fraud Techniques:</b>

<p>One notable aspect of the ad fraud scheme was the use of counterfeit apps on major app marketplaces such as the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Within these apps, a module created hidden WebViews used to request, render, and click on ads while masquerading ad requests as originating from legitimate apps.</p>

<b>Cybersecurity Response:</b>

<p>Cybersecurity firm HUMAN worked closely with Apple and Google to disrupt the operation. It's worth noting that the majority of BADBOX's infrastructure, including the servers powering the firmware backdoor infection, has been taken down by the threat actors. However, an update pushed out earlier this year removed the modules powering PEACHPIT on BADBOX-infected devices in response to mitigation measures deployed in November 2022, suggesting that the attackers are adapting their tactics to evade detection.</p>

<b>The Ongoing Threat:</b>

<p>The level of obfuscation employed by the threat actors is indicative of their increased sophistication, making it challenging to detect and combat the operation. Individuals are advised to remain vigilant, and buyers of electronic devices are cautioned to be mindful of their sources to avoid inadvertently purchasing infected products.</p>

<p>As the investigation continues, the cybersecurity community is working tirelessly to stay one step ahead of cybercriminals like those behind PEACHPIT and BADBOX.</p>
