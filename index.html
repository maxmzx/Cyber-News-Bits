                <a href="article.html">DarkGate Malware Exploits Microsoft Teams and Skype to Spread via Deceptive PDFs</a>
              </h3>
              <p>1. Delivery Method: DarkGate is being distributed through instant messaging applications, where a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) loader script is sent, masquerading as a PDF document. When the recipient opens this document, it triggers the download and execution of an AutoIt script, which ultimately launches the DarkGate malware.</p>
              <p>2. Unclear Origin of Compromised Accounts: It is uncertain how the attackers compromised the originating accounts used to send the malware, but it is hypothesized to be through either leaked credentials available on underground forums or the compromise of the parent organization.</p>
              <p>3. DarkGate Malware: DarkGate is described as commodity malware that can harvest sensitive data from web browsers, conduct cryptocurrency mining, and allow remote control of infected hosts. It also serves as a downloader of additional payloads like the Remcos RAT.</p>
              <p>4. Recent Surge in Attacks: Social engineering campaigns distributing DarkGate have witnessed a surge in recent months, using tactics like phishing emails and search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning to trick users into installing the malware. This increase in activity is attributed to the decision of the malware author to advertise and rent DarkGate on underground forums.</p>
              <p>5. Use of Microsoft Teams Chat Messages: Microsoft Teams chat messages have been used as a propagation vector for DarkGate. This technique exploits the trust between organizations and deceives recipients into executing the attached VBA script.</p>
              <p>6. Global Spread: Most of the DarkGate attacks have been detected in the Americas, followed by Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, according to Trend Micro.</p>
              <p>7. Infection Procedure: The VBA script acts as a conduit to fetch the legitimate AutoIt application and an associated AutoIT script responsible for launching the DarkGate malware. Another attack sequence involves sending a Microsoft Teams message with a ZIP archive attachment containing an LNK file, which runs a VBA script to retrieve and execute the DarkGate artifact.</p>
              <p>8. Malware Payloads: Cybercriminals can use DarkGate to infect systems with various types of malware, including information stealers, ransomware, remote management tools, and cryptocurrency miners.</p>
              <p>9. Risk with Instant Messaging Apps: As long as external messaging is allowed or abuse of trusted relationships via compromised accounts goes unchecked, this technique for initial entry can be used with any instant messaging app.</p>
