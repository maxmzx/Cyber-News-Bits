              </h3>
              <p>Scientists have captured a rare stellar event thanks to the latest space technology. 
                The sparkling sea green comet Nishimura gave skywatchers on Earth a rare once-in-430-years 
                glimpse just days ago. It has now helped us witness an extraordinary event where it was 
                smashed into by a powerful solar storm as it did a slingshot around the Sun. The event took place right after Nishimura successfully lived through its closest approach to the Sun amid fears that it might burn up. It was then hit by a possible coronal mass ejection. The comet saw its bright green trail cut off from the powerful solar storm, with a NASA spacecraft capturing the event. A video clip of the comet losing its tail has also been released and is wowing netizens. It was captured by NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO-A) spacecraft.</p>         </div>

              <a href="article.html">FBI Warns of Rising Trend of Dual Ransomware Attacks Targeting U.S. Companies</a>
            </h3>
            <p>The FBI has issued a warning about a new trend in 
              ransomware attacks, where cybercriminals deploy two 
              different ransomware variants against the same victims. 
              This practice has been observed since at least July 2023, 
              with various ransomware variants being used in combinations.
               These dual attacks often occur within close proximity to each other,
                typically within 48 hours to 10 days. Additionally, ransomware attackers are increasingly using custom data theft, wiper tools, and malware to pressure victims into paying ransoms. This combination of tactics can result in data encryption, exfiltration, and financial losses for victims. It's essential for organizations to strengthen their cybersecurity defenses by maintaining offline backups, monitoring remote connections, enforcing multi-factor authentication, auditing user accounts, and segmenting networks to prevent ransomware spread. This trend is driven by factors like the exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities and the involvement of initial access brokers and affiliates in the ransomware landscape.</p>   <img src="img/article/hockey.jpg" alt="">

            </h3>
            <p>Malicious ads within Microsoft Bing's AI 
              chatbot, Bing Chat, are being used to 
              distribute malware when users search for 
            popular tools. These ads, introduced in February 2023, 
            can trick users into visiting malicious sites and installing
             malware directly from chat conversations. For example, 
             a legitimate software search could return a link with a malicious 
             ad before the official site. Clicking the link takes users to a 
             traffic direction system (TDS), and from there, a decoy page containing 
             rogue installer scripts. Threat actors have infiltrated the ad accounts of 
             legitimate businesses to create these ads. This underscores the evolving nature 
             of cyber threats and the importance of caution when clicking on links or ads.

            </h3>
            <p>Xenomorph malware has 
              resurfaced in a new distribution 
              campaign, targeting over 30 US banks and various
               financial institutions worldwide. Cybersecurity 
               analysts from ThreatFabric uncovered this resurgence, 
               revealing that the campaign uses deceptive phishing webpages 
               posing as Chrome updates to lure victims into downloading malicious 
               APKs. Xenomorph is known for using overlays to capture personally 
               identifiable information (PII) and features a sophisticated automated 
               transfer system (ATS) engine. The latest campaign has expanded geographically, 
               with numerous Xenomorph downloads in Spain and the United States. The malware has 
               also added new capabilities, including anti-sleep features and touch action simulation, 
               making it highly adaptable. It is being distributed alongside other powerful desktop stealers 
               and offered as Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS), highlighting cybercriminals' persistent efforts to
                maximize profits. Xenomorph remains a significant Android Banking malware threat.</p>  </article>

              </h3>
              <p>A new sophisticated phishing campaign was discovered by security researchers that targets hotels, booking sites, and travel agencies, designed to steal the financial data of custom The hackers compromise and send phishing messages via the affected service’s official communication channels.
                
                Researchers at Perception Point found that the campaign begins with a seemingly harmless query or reference to an existing hotel reservation. It also uses advanced social engineering techniques and then send allegedly important documents via a URL.
                
                After clicking the URL, the victim is directed to an info-stealing malware. This malicious software is adept at collecting sensitive information, including credentials and financial data.
                
                The final phase of the attack involves the victim receiving a link for alleged credit card verification. This unveils a fake Booking.com payment page – designed to be another method of stealing the user’s financial info.
                
                Researchers from Akamai noted that the attackers gain access to legitimate customer communication channels after infiltrating the hotel’s systems. This provides them with a direct and trusted channel to their victims. Under the guise of the compromised hotel, booking service, or travel agency, the cybercriminals are able to send phishing messages that closely mimic genuine requests.
                
                Users must remain vigilant to protect against such phishing campaigns. Avoid clicking on unsolicited links, even if they seem legitimate, and exercise caution with messages urging immediate action.</p>   </div>
